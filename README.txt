The primary script that will be used to collect data is Twitter.py, and its usage is simple.
Just run the script with ./twitter.py
then specify which user you would like to collect data from. 
The data will be stored as a JSON file in the specified folder/container,
for the linear regression script to perform analytics.


The linear regression script requires the data to be a JSON file and it also 
requires the user to go inside the script directly and change the value of 
"path" variable to the location of the JSON file the user wishes to read. 
During runtime the user types in the file name without the .json in the name 
(this is case sensitive) and the relevant data will be shown.
